## Build a reusable modal component drawn from the spec image above. 

__The spec:__
1) Header, body and footer sections with a flexible body section. The modal should have a min-width of 380px and max height of 70% of the viewport. In mobile the modal should take up the entire screen when open.  
2) Header section to display Header (string of modal) and a close (x) -button.
3) Body with customizable content
4) Footer to include 1) Secondary action button and 2) Primary action button
5) The modal should be centered above a semi-transparent black overlay.


You can use any frontend framework or library for the assignment but not any styled front-end libraries/ui-kits like react-spectrum or atlassian design system.
Build a running demo of the component in a repo with clear instructions how to build and run the demo. Tests are optional but good karma.
